=== What are OpenShift Operators?

Red Hat® OpenShift® Operators automate the creation, configuration, and management of instances of Kubernetes-native applications. Operators provide automation at every level of the stack—from managing the parts that make up the platform all the way to applications that are provided as a managed service.

Wait for the pods to come up.  You should see a database (default to postgres) and a keycloak-0 pods managed by a Kubernetes StatefulSet

Now that SSO is installed lets login to our newly created SSO. 

Before we do that, you need to obtain the administrator password that was automatically generated by the operator.

<1> Menu > 'Secrets' > 'credential-example-keycloal'
<2> 'Reveal Values'
<3> Keep the password for future usage
